# The Thing

## Introduction

_The Thing_ is a card game that re-creates the excitement and paranoia of John Carpenter's 1982 movie of the same name. The players are a team of scientists; trapped in an Antarctic research base with a shape-shifting alien which can take on a form unperceivable from their human victims. Their only hope for survival is to escape the compound on a rescue helicopter, but for the sake of the human race, they must be sure not to bring any unwelcome guests with them!

## Gameplay Summary

The Thing is a traditional card game in which players take turns in clockwise order. Turns start with the player replenishing their cards from the deck up to the hand size of five. On each turn, the player can perform a single action before moving on to the next player. 

If a player gets a red Queen in their initial hand, they start the game as an alien. The only way a human player can become infected is by unwittingly trading or stealing a red card. Once infected, nothing can disinfect the player.

If at any point a human player adds a red card to their hand, that human is now a Thing. They should hide this fact from the other players. Their goal is now to infect or kill the other players.

Players take their action on each turn to help their survival. Through these actions, the players work to strengthen their respective hands and reveal and eliminate the alien threat. These actions are as follows:

- Scavenge
- Attack
- Blood Test
- Steal
- Propose a Trade
- Propose Helicopter Escape

If at any point a player's hand is empty, that player is dead, and they are out of the game.

Once the players are sure that there are no remaining aliens, they must unanimously agree that it is safe for them to board the rescue helicopter and escape.

The aliens win the game if they manage to kill all the other players or convince them of their humanity and successfully board the helicopter. The humans win if all remaining human survivors escape without any aliens.

## Set-Up

The Thing is played with multiple standard decks of playing cards. The dealer must build the deck accordingly for the number of players. Start by sorting the decks into the following piles, and return everything else to the boxes:

- Red Queens (queen alien cards)
- Black face cards (blood test cards)
- Black number cards and Aces shuffled (weapon and steal cards)
- Red number cards, no Aces shuffled (alien weapon cards) (shuffled)
- 1 Joker (disease card)

Firstly, determine how many starting players should be aliens, and gather this number of red Queen cards (returning the remainder to their boxes). You should tailor this number to your group's preferences. As a recommended starting point, take
the minimum number from the second column, then up this if you feel the balance is too far towards the humans:

| Number of Players  | Number of Queens |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 4-5                | 1                |
| 6-8                | 1-2              |
| 9-10               | 2-3              |
| 11-12              | 2-4              |

> For a more chaotic game, it can be more interesting to randomise the number of starting Queens there are such
> that no player knows the exact number. To do this, add an extra red Queen, along with a random black
> number card, to a hand and shuffle. Present this, face down, to another player, who should select one
> at random, and remove it from play by adding it back to the box. Insert these cards as per the setup
> rules for Queens below.

Add enough black number cards to the stack of Queens so that there are one per player, then shuffle and deal one to each player.

Deal two more cards per player from the black number cards, so each player should have a hand of three.

Create and shuffle a draw pile with:

- 3 black number cards per player
- 20 red number cards

Create a discard pile and place facing upwards in the centre of the table. This pile should contain one black face card per player.

Place a joker beside the discard pile.

Return the remaining cards to the box; they won't be used.

Finally, play a single round where each player just replenishes their hand up to five cards. (See section 'Replenishing Player's Hand' below.)

> Note that these setup rules should be considered more of a guideline than a hard and fast set of rules. Over time you
> should experiment with these rules to tailor the game to your group. For example, try and balance the number of red
> cards if you feel the aliens are at an advantage/disadvantage. Consider including a random chance of some black face
> cards into the initial deal if you want to allow the players to perform a blood test during the first round. If your
> group doesn't enjoy the disease mechanic feel free to leave the Joker out of the discard pile.

## Play

Starting left of the dealer (or however else you want to choose the starting player) and proceeding clockwise, players each take a turn consisting of two phases: replenishing their hand and performing an action.

### Replenishing Player's Hand

At the start of their turn, a player must replenish their hand up to five cards by drawing cards one by one from the draw pile. Human players can never be infected in this way, so if they draw a red card, they _must_ place it face up in the discard pile. If the player is an alien and draws a red card, they have the option of either keeping it in their hand or placing it face up in the discard pile. If any player draws a black card, they _must_ keep it in their hand.

If the player draws the last card in the draw pile, the discard piles should be combined, shuffled, and placed face down to form the new draw pile.

If the player draws the Joker, then the disease event occurs (see section 'Disease'). The disease event should be played out to completion, then the player's turn is over.

### Perform an Action

Once the player's hand is replenished, they must choose one of the following actions. 

#### Scavenge

To attempt to strengthen their hand safely, the player can scavenge the surrounding area for weapons. To do this, they draw the top card from the draw deck then they must place a card _face-down_ in the discard pile. (Keeping a separate discard pile for face-down cards.) Similar to replenishing, humans can never be infected through this action, so if they draw a red card, they must discard that one. Otherwise, they can choose any card to discard. Aliens can always choose what card to discard with this action.

> The scavenge action is 100% safe from infection. However, there is a relatively high chance of drawing a red card,
> thus wasting the turn; this should be taken into consideration when choosing this action over the 'Propose a Trade' or
> 'Steal' actions (see below).

#### Steal

If the player has any Ace cards, they can play them to steal cards from another player. They nominate a target and play as many Aces as they like to steal that many cards, except they can never steal the target's last card. After the player has performed the steal action, the played Aces are placed face up in the discard pile.

When having a card stolen from them, the victim of the theft _must_ choose and hold a single card back. They then present the remaining cards face down to the player, who takes the cards at random.

When choosing the card to hold back, it's crucial to enforce the rule that _an infected player can never be disinfected_; To ensure this, if the player is an alien and only has a single red card, then they _must_ hold back that red card.

> Cunning aliens who have more than one red card may hold back a black card so long as the resulting theft is
> guaranteed not to remove their last red card.
>
> Example:
>
> _Alice has played a single Ace and has chosen to steal a card from Bob. Bob has two red cards, and three
> black. Bob knows that — as Alice can only steal one card — he can safely present both red cards without 
> a chance of him losing his last red card. He, therefore, holds back one of his black cards to increase
> the chance of infection._

#### Propose a Trade

As their action, a player can offer a card up for trade. The player announces the card's value, and players go around the table clockwise, saying what they would be willing to trade. Once all players have made their offer, the original player can accept one of the offers and make the trade.

Note: at this stage, no player is obliged to go through with the trade. At any stage, either player can back out. (A player may use this tactic to try and sniff out an alien. If they are willing to make a trade that has seemingly little benefit to them, it could be a sign that they are trying to infect you.) If an offer falls through in this way, the original player may then accept a different one.

When the trade goes ahead, the players exchange cards and add them to their hands without showing them to anyone else. You can only trade a card that has the value which you offered during the bidding. It's entirely permissible for you to lie about the value of a card while bidding. (For example, you can offer a 10 card which you don't have.). However, you can not then go through with the exchange with that card. If you do not have the card you offered, then you must decline to complete the offer. The one exception to this rule is the red Queen card. It is permissible to pretend that the red Queen is a 10 or a blood test card for the sake of trading.

As always, it's crucial that _an infected player can never be disinfected_. To this end, an alien player can not lose their last red card by offering it in a trade.

If the players fail to complete an exchange, then the turn ends.

> Example:
>
> _It's Christina's turn. She announces to the group: "I'm offering up a 9 for trade."_
>
> _Dave has no intention of taking a card from Christina, suspecting that she's infected. He offers a
> 3 (which he doesn't have) in return, hoping she will accept the offer and cast further suspicion among
> the group._
>
> _Erica has another 9. Christina's 9 would make a pair and thus make her hand very powerful. She offers
> an 8 in return._
>
> _Frank rejects the offer._
>
> _Alice is an alien and has a single red 8, which she offers._
>
> _Bob rejects the offer._
>
> _Now all player's offers have been made, Christina needs to choose an offer to accept. She has a single
> 8 in her hand, so Erica and Alice's offers are attractive to her._
>
> _Christina chooses to accept Alice's offer. However, Alice can't give her red 8 as it would disinfect her,
> so she declines the exchange._
>
> _Cristina now turns to Erica. Erica offers her 8 face-down, and Christing passes her 9 in return. The
> exchange is complete._

> _Optionally, your game can allow the trading of multiple cards. When doing this, you can offer up any number of
> cards from your hand, except for the last one (again, maintaining that _an infected player can never be
> disinfected_). Counteroffers must be for the same number of cards as the original offer._
> 
> _Trading multiple cards is generally a dangerous move, but it can be fun. For this reason, we only
> recommend it for advanced players._

#### Blood Test

If the player has any black picture cards, they can play them to blood test another player. Using this action, players attempt to reveal whether or not the target is an alien. The player nominates a target player and places their blood test cards face up. They can play as many cards as they have, though a blood test can never reveal the player's last card.

The target player now presents their hand face down, and the tester takes as many cards as the number of blood test cards they played, looks at them then returns them to the target's hand.

At this stage, the player is allowed (but is not obligated) to state whether they saw a red card. They are not permitted to reveal the value of the cards.

> Example:
>
> _Dave has three blood test cards and wants to use them on Christina. However, Christina currently only has
> three cards, meaning he can only play two of them. A blood test can never reveal a player's last card._
>
> _Dave places two blood test cards face up, stating: 'I'm blood testing Christina.'_
>
> _Christina's feelings are hurt, but she presents her hand face down for Dave to inspect._
>
> _Dave takes two cards from the hand and looks at them. There's a pair of black 8s, which he returns to the hand._
> 
> _He announces: 'I didn't see any reds. This time!'_

#### Attack

As their action, a player may elect to attack one of the other players. They do this by placing any number of cards down, facing their target. The value of the played cards adds to the total combat score.

See the section 'Combat' for the complete combat rules.

#### Propose Helicopter Escape

If a player believes that all the remaining players are human (or if they are an alien who feels they can get away with it), then that player can spend their action to propose they board the helicopter. When this happens, all players vote on whether they agree with the proposal. If all players agree, then the helicopter is boarded, and the game is over. (See the section 'Ending the Game')

The helicopter always requires two people to pilot. If only one player is left alive, they remain stranded in the base.

If a player starts their turn and only two players remain, both players have no choice but to board the helicopter, whether they trust each other or not.

### Disease

When a player draws the Joker (disease card) from the draw pile, their turn is immediately over, and the disease spreads. Starting with the player to the left of that player, every player will lose a card. They do this by holding back a card (again, enforcing the rule _an infected player can never be disinfected_), presenting their hand to the player on their left who takes a card at random. They will then place this card face down on the discard pile before showing their cards to the player on their left.

If a player only has one card, it is placed face down on the discard pile; that player is dead. Nobody is allowed to see that card, nor should the player announce if they were an alien; The answer to that mystery goes with them to their grave!

After the disease phase, place the card aside next to the discard pile. When a player next shuffles the discard into the draw deck, they should add the Joker to the face-up discard pile. It won't come into play again until the next time this happens.

### Combat

A player initiates combat by spending their action to nominate a target. When this happens, they place their first cards down into the attacking combat pool. These players are now in combat, and combat is always to the death. It's now the attacking player's combat phase.

When placing attack cards, cards of the same value played in a pair are worth three times the card's value (e.g., a pair of threes is worth nine in total.)

In combat, a red Queen has a value of ten. However, it does not pair with other 10 cards. (If you like, you can optionally make an exception to this rule. However, the aliens tend to get a much better selection of combat cards already; This could tip the balance too far in their favour.) Other picture cards (blood tests) and Aces (thefts) are only worth one in combat and only pair with like cards (e.g., Aces only pair with other Aces).

The combat phase completes when that team adds cards that are greater than the opponent's pool. It is now the opposing team's combat phase, and they must place cards to beat their opponent's combat score.

At any point, a player can join the side who is currently in their combat phase and are adding cards to their pool. To do this, they place their cards in the relevant combat pool and their value to the combat score. This player is now engaged in combat until the end and can never change sides.

Whenever a player places the last card in their hand, they are dead and are out of the game. Player's should be aware of this and attempt to solicit help from the other players (who are not already engaged in the combat) before placing this card. When a player dies, no more players are allowed to join on their side.

Note: only cards played together as a pair have the bonus value, so a card can not be paired with a previously played card of the same value to get the bonus combat score.

Combat is the only exception to the rule that _an infected player can never be disinfected_. It is permitted for a player to add their last red card into the combat pool at any stage. From this stage on, that player has revealed their identity (which the other players should note!).

> Example:
>
> _Dave, still convinced that Christina is an alien, has decided to take matters into his own hands and spends
> his action to attack her. He places a pair of 5s down into his combat pool and nominates Christina as the
> target, completing his combat phase with a combat score of fifteen._
>
> _Christina places her pair of black eights and ends her phase with a combat score of twenty-seven._
>
> _Dave now needs to beat Christina's score of twenty-seven. He has an Ace, 4, and an 8 in his hand, the total
> value of which is 13; not enough to beat Christina's score. Knowing this, he attempts to solicit help from the
> other players._
>
> _Frank distrusts Christina also. However, he doesn't entirely trust Dave. He suggests that he will join the
> combat if Dave plays two more cards to show they aren't red._
>
> _Dave is reluctant to do so, as that would leave him with a single card. Even if they win the combat he
> could then a disease card could result in his death. However, he has bitten off more than he can chew and
> begrudgingly places his 4 and 8 in the pool, bringing his combat score up to twenty-seven — matching,
> but not beating Christina's._
> 
> _Frank, true to his word, places a pair of 7s, adding twenty-one to the combat pool and bringing their
> total up to forty-eight. This ends their combat phase._
>
> _Christina is down to her last remaining card (a black 6). Not wanting to be taken out, she attempts to
> solicit help from the other players. However, nobody agrees to join the combat on her side. She now has no
> choice but to play her final card, killing her. Her new total is thirty-three, which is not enough to beat
> the opponent team's forty-eight, so the combat is over._
>
> _Dave and Frank sheepishly realise that they've killed another human and strengthened the alien team._

## Ending the Game

There are several ways in which the game can end, and it can be unclear the extent to which the team has won. If the aliens board the helicopter, they can spread the infection throughout the planet; This is the ultimate alien victory.

If all humans live and escape on the helicopter, this is the ultimate human victory.

If nobody boards the helicopter, and only humans or aliens remain, this is a hollow victory for that side, as they're doomed to die in antarctic conditions anyway.

Everything in-between is a grey area and can be interpreted however the players see fit!
